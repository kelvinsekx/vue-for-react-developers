### Vue comparison with React from Vue's official docs

This provides an abstract overview of why Vue is chosen over React. Since it is coming from Vue docs, they did well to sell themselves over ReactJS.

### Complete work through of a React component into Vue's

- [A walk-through on writing component from React to Vue3 by Alex Riviere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b6T3KN5pRs)

Alex Riviere did justice in working through how to write components in React with JSX into JSX in Vue and then into Vue's glorified SFCs.

But please his argument on why devs use React over Vue is just a joke.
